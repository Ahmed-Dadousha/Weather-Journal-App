# Weather-Journal-App

## Introduction

    This is a weather journal website. You can get current tempreature and date of now using zip code of any city.

## Technologies

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Javascript
- nodejs
- express

## Features

    I have used "openweatheramp api" to get current tempreature.
    The app will fetch "tempreature" from openweathermap api and "user feeling" from input "textbox" and the date using "Date library" in javascript the it will "post" it all to server in the backend then it will fetch it again but from the server in backend not from "openweathermap api".

## Setup

- Install dependencies `npm i express cors body-parser`.

## Usage

- Run `node server.js` to start the server.
- Go to `127.0.0.1:8000` in your browser.
